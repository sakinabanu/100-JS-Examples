// JavaScript Program to Find the Square Root :
let a = 4
console.log(`The square root of ${a} is ${Math.floor(Math.sqrt(a))}`);

let b = "Javascript"
console.log(`The square root of ${b} is ${Math.floor(Math.sqrt(b))}`);

let c = -5
console.log(`The square root of ${c} is ${Math.floor(Math.sqrt(c))}`);

let d = 34
console.log(`The square root of ${d} is ${Math.floor(Math.sqrt(d))}`);
console.log(`The square root of ${d} is ${Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(d))}`);
console.log(`The square root of ${d} is ${Math.round(Math.sqrt(d))}`);
console.log(`The square root of ${d} is ${(Math.sqrt(d))}`);
